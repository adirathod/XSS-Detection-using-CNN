#XSS Detection using CNN

This repository contains a project focused on detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project includes three Python files and two datasets.

Project Structure
XSS_ML5Models.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing machine learning models for XSS detection. Requires the "XSS attack Dataset with 461 entries.xlsx" dataset.
XSS_using_CNN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file implementing CNN for XSS detection. Requires the "XSS_dataset.csv" dataset.
XSS_using_TextCNN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file implementing TextCNN for XSS detection. Also requires the "XSS_dataset.csv" dataset.

datasets:
XSS attack Dataset with 461 entries.xlsx: Excel file containing XSS attack data for use with ML models.
XSS_dataset.csv: CSV file containing XSS attack data for use with CNN and TextCNN models.


How to Run
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already or you can use Google Colab.
Open the desired Python files (XSS_ML5Models.ipynb, XSS_using_CNN.ipynb, XSS_using_TextCNN.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that the respective dataset (XSS attack Dataset with 461 entries.xlsx for XSS_ML5Models.ipynb and XSS_dataset.csv for XSS_using_CNN.ipynb and XSS_using_TextCNN.ipynb) is available in the same directory as the Datasets.

Follow the instructions provided within each Python file to execute the code and analyze the results.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the Python files, including libraries such as Pandas, NumPy etc.
